/* [Q2] What is the average rating in each quarter?
-- Very Bad is 1, Bad is 2, Okay is 3, Good is 4, Very Good is 5.

Hint: Use a common table expression and in that CTE, assign numbers to the different customer ratings. 
      Now average the feedback for each quarter. 

Note: For reference, refer to question number 4. Week-2: mls_week-2_gl-beats_solution-1.sql. 
      You'll get an overview of how to use common table expressions from this question.*/

/* [Q3] Are customers getting more dissatisfied over time?

Hint: Need the percentage of different types of customer feedback in each quarter. Use a common table expression and
	  determine the number of customer feedback in each category as well as the total number of customer feedback in each quarter.
	  Now use that common table expression to find out the percentage of different types of customer feedback in each quarter.
      Eg: (total number of very good feedback/total customer feedback)* 100 gives you the percentage of very good feedback.

Hint: Quarter over Quarter percentage change in revenue means what is the change in revenue from the subsequent quarter to the previous quarter in percentage.
      To calculate you need to use the common table expression to find out the sum of revenue for each quarter.
      Then use that CTE along with the LAG function to calculate the QoQ percentage change in revenue.
